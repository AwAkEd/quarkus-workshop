## What is Quarkus?

image::logo.png[]

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot,window=_blank] and offers a unified imperative and reactive programming model and a number of other developer features like Live Reload to bring _real joy to your development_.

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.
 
## Click-to-Copy
You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises. Some of
the command blocks can be copy/pasted directly. Others will require modification
of the command before execution, for example to add your unique user ID assigned by the instructor. If you see a command block with a red border
(see below), the command will require slight modification.

[source,none,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
some command to modify
----

Others, including source code snippets can by copy/pasted directly, and do not require modification.

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Most command blocks support auto highlighting with a click. If you hover over
the command block above and left-click, it should automatically highlight all the
text to make for easier copying.

## Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipe Che,window=_blank]. To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[access the Che instance,window=_blank] and log in using the username and password you've been assigned (e.g. `userNN/passNN`):

image::che-login.png[login,600]

Once you log in, you'll be placed on your personal dashboard allowing you to spawn new workspaces to work on code in a traditional IDE environment. Click on the **Add Workspace** tab on the left, and select the _Quarkus Java_ stack, and click **Create & Open** to start the workspace:

After a minute or two, you'll be placed in the workspace:

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
