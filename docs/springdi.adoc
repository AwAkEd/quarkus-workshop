Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot^] and offers a unified imperative and reactive programming model and a number of other developer features like Live Reload to bring _real joy_ to your development.

*Red Hat* offers the fully supported https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus[Red Hat Build of Quarkus(RHBQ)^] with support and maintenance of Quarkus. In this workhop, you will use Quarkus to develop Kubernetes-native microservices and deploy them to OpenShift. Quarkus is one of the runtimes included in https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^]. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_quarkus[Learn more about RHBQ^].

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== If you've already completed the Quarkus Basic Hands-on Lab Today

*If you have completed the Basic lab today*, you can scroll/skip down to the **List Extensions** exercise to continue your Quarkus lab. If not, then continue below:

== First Step: Set Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 700]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

## Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[CodeReady Workspaces^]. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[access the CodeReady Workspaces instance^] and log in using the username and password you've been assigned:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

image::che-login.png[login,400]

Once you log in, you'll be placed on your personal dashboard. We've pre-created workspaces for you to use. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green button that says "OPEN" on the top right hand side of the screen:

image::che-precreated.png[precreated,800]

After a minute or two, you'll be placed in the workspace:

image::che-workspace.png[workspace,800]

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  Youâ€™ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

## Import Project

Let's import our project. Click on **Git Clone..** (or type kbd:[F1], enter 'git' and click on the auto-completed _Git Clone.._ )

image::che-workspace-gitclone.png[cdw, 900]

Step through the prompts, using the following value for **Repository URL**:

[source,none,role="copypaste"]
----
https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/quarkus-workshop-labs
----

image::crw-clone-repo.png[crw,900]

The project is imported into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer (click on the top-most icon for project explorer):

image::crw-clone-explorer.png[crw,900]

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a
terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:

image::cmd-terminal.png[codeready-workspace-terminal, 500]
====

==== IMPORTANT: Check out proper Git branch

To make sure you're using the right version of the project files, run this command in a CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-labs && git checkout rhtr2020
----

The project has

* The Maven structure
* An `org.acme.people.rest.GreetingResource` resource exposed on `/hello`, along with a simple test
* A landing page that is accessible on `http://localhost:8080` after starting the application
* The application configuration file
* Other source files we'll use later
